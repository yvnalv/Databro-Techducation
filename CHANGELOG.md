CHG-0001 — Initial project documentation

- Established the foundational documentation set: `CLAUDE.md` master instructions, `README.md`, and
  the `docs/` tree (PRD, ROADMAP, STATUS, ARCHITECTURE, MODULES, DATABASE, CONTENT_MODEL,
  FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE, SEO, API_SPEC, SECURITY, BUSINESS_RULES, ERROR_HANDLING, DECISIONS,
  CODING_STANDARDS, TESTING, DEPLOYMENT, GLOSSARY).
- Recorded the initial architecture decisions as ADR-0001 through ADR-0007.
- Locked the load-bearing decisions: Modular Monolith + Clean Architecture; B2C-first tenancy;
  articles-first wedge; in-house CMS scoped to articles for Phase 1; unified Article/Lesson content
  engine; typed JSONB content blocks; two-app frontend monorepo; PostgreSQL FTS for initial search.
- No application code yet — design phase.
